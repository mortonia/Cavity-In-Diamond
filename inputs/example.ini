[host]
; Element symbol for the host crystal (rare gas recommended)
element = Ne

; ASE bulk crystal structure name: fcc | bcc | hcp | diamond
crystal_structure = fcc

; Lattice constant in Å
lattice_constant = 4.46368

; Supercell repetition counts: nx, ny, nz
repeat = 9, 9, 9


[guest]
; Path to the guest molecule XYZ (relative to repo root is fine)
molecule = molecules_xyz/water.xyz


[cavity]
; Extra padding used by some utilities (e.g., ellipsoid sizing or orientation search)
buffer = 0.10

; OPTIONAL override for cavity radii in Å (uncomment to use)
; radii = 3.0, 2.5, 3.2


[placement]
; Placement mode: midplane | fractional | cartesian
mode = midplane

; Midplane axis: x | y | z  (used when mode = midplane)
axis = x

; Midplane index (between unit cells index and index+1)  (used when mode = midplane)
index = 4

; Small degeneracy-breaking nudge as a fraction of the lattice constant (e.g., 0.02–0.08)
bias_frac = 0.05

; OPTIONAL small Cartesian tweak in Å (applied after center selection)
; nudge = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0

; OPTIONAL fractional center across entire supercell (used when mode = fractional)
; center = 0.5, 0.5, 0.5

; OPTIONAL explicit Cartesian center in Å (used when mode = cartesian)
; center_cart = 10.0, 20.0, 15.0


[orient]
; Enable coarse orientation search to maximize minimal host–guest distance (recommended for bulky guests)
enable = false

; Number of yaw samples (around +Y by default)
yaw_steps = 12

; Number of pitch samples
pitch_steps = 6

; Number of roll samples
roll_steps = 1

; OPTIONAL early stop if minimal distance ≥ this value (Å)
; clearance_floor = 3.3


[clearance]
; Pre-trim mode before insertion:
;   off   = do nothing (enforces single vacancy only)
;   lj    = remove hosts that violate r_min(sigma_mix) * rmin_scale (may remove >1 atom)
;   fixed = remove hosts closer than 'min' Å (may remove >1 atom)
mode = off

; Scale factor for LJ r_min threshold when mode = lj
rmin_scale = 1.00

; Fixed Å threshold when mode = fixed
min = 3.0


[extract]
; Radius in Å for the final spherical fragment around the guest
radius = 12.0


[output]
; Output directory (created if missing; collision policy applies)
dir = outputs

; Handling when the output directory already exists:
;   increment | timestamp | overwrite | fail
collision_policy = increment
